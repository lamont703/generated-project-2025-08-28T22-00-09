# Project Bombs Over Bagdhad - Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the "Bombs Over Bagdhad" project. This project aims to create a platform leveraging the power of chat agents to streamline various aspects of product development and marketing.  Three core agents will handle distinct functionalities:

1. **Prototype Generation Agent:** This agent will assist users in generating prototypes for their projects.  By interacting with the agent, users will be able to define their project requirements and receive a basic prototype as a starting point.

2. **Developer Profile Generation Agent:** This agent focuses on creating detailed developer profiles.  It will gather information about a developer's skills, experience, and project history to generate a comprehensive profile suitable for showcasing expertise and attracting potential collaborators or clients.

3. **Lead Capture Agent for Prototyped Projects:** This agent plays a crucial role in capturing leads for projects that have been prototyped using the platform. It will interact with potential users or investors, gather their contact information, and gauge their interest in the presented prototypes.

## Target Audience
This platform is designed to cater to the needs of both businesses and individual creators looking to streamline their product development process and effectively market their projects.

## Technology Stack
The project will leverage the following technologies:
* **Gemini:**  Provides the foundation for the chat agent functionality.
* **Github:**  Serves as the platform for code storage, version control, and collaboration.
